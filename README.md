# Dummy fuzzer

First, lets answer the most important question of this repo:
**Why?!**
**__becouse I can__** :)

I was inspired by GynvaelColdwind of course.


The main reason of writting this code is fun and practice. If you need really good and convinient fuzzer go for [AFL] (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)


### Usage





TODO
-[ ] argument parsing
-[ ] parsing config file
-[ ] tbd.
